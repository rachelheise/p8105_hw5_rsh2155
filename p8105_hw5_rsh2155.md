## Problem 1

Import and clean data.

``` r
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
aggregate_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Prop test for a single city

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Iterate

``` r
results_df =
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Different option for nesting data and writing a function.

``` r
city_prop_test = function(df) {
  
  n_unsolved ...
  n_total ...
  
  prop.test(....)
  
}
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ## Error: <text>:3:14: unexpected symbol
    ## 2:   
    ## 3:   n_unsolved ...
    ##                 ^

## Problem 2

Create dataframe containing names of data files. Add data from each file
to dataframe.

``` r
longitudinal_df =
  tibble(files = list.files("./lda_data/")) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(file.path("./lda_data/", files), read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8,
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "observation") %>% 
  mutate(week = substr(week, 6, 7),
         files = substr(files, 1, 6),
         full_subject = files) %>% 
  separate(files, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_")
```

## Problem 3

for 6 you should reject the null more of the time (conduct the same t
test)

``` r
set.seed(1)
t_test_sim = function(samp_size = 30, sigma = 5, mu) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = samp_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
  
  test = t.test(sim_data, mu = 0)
  
  sim_data %>% 
    summarize(
      est_mean = mean(x),
      p_value = pull(broom::tidy(test), p.value)
  )
}

sim_results = tibble(
  pop_mean = c(0:6)
) %>% 
  mutate(
  output_lists = map(.x = pop_mean, ~rerun(5000, t_test_sim(mu = .x))),
  estimate_df = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
  ) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_df)
```

``` r
sim_results %>% 
  group_by(pop_mean) %>% 
  summarize(n_reject = sum(p_value < 0.05),
            prop_reject = n_reject/5000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pop_mean, y = prop_reject)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "True Mean vs. Proportion of Samples Rejected")
```

It appears that for most population mean values, the sample average of
the estimated population mean is approximately equal to the true mean
from which those values originated. This is because we are sampling from
a normal distribution with a two-sided hypothesis test, meaning that
approximately half of the sample means which reject the null will fall
in the rejection region less than the true mean, and approximately half
will fall in the rejection region greater than the true mean. This means
that the average of all of the sample means which rejected the null will
be quite close to the true population mean. Looking at the above plot,
this holds true for population means of 0, 4, 5, and 6. For 1, 2, and 3,
there were more points that were higher than the average leading them to
be rejected.
