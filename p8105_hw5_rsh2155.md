## Problem 1

Import and clean data.

``` r
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
aggregate_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Prop test for a single city

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Iterate

``` r
results_df =
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Different option for nesting data and writing a function.

``` r
city_prop_test = function(df) {
  
  n_unsolved ...
  n_total ...
  
  prop.test(....)
  
}
homicide_df =
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ## Error: <text>:3:14: unexpected symbol
    ## 2:   
    ## 3:   n_unsolved ...
    ##                 ^

## Problem 2

Create dataframe containing names of data files. Add data from each file
to dataframe.

``` r
longitudinal_df =
  tibble(files = list.files("./lda_data/")) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(file.path("./lda_data/", files), read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>% 
  pivot_longer(week_1:week_8,
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "observation") %>% 
  mutate(week = substr(week, 6, 7),
         files = substr(files, 1, 6),
         full_subject = files) %>% 
  separate(files, into = c("arm", "subject_id"), sep = "_")
```

Spaghetti plot

``` r
longitudinal_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = full_subject, color = arm)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Observations Over Time for Control & Experimental Arms",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Observation"
  )
```

## Problem 3

for 6 you should reject the null more of the time (conduct the same t
test)

``` r
n = 30
sigma = 5
mu = 0


t_test_sim = function(samp_size, mu, sigma) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(samp_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
  
  test = t.test(dataset)
  
  sim_data %>% 
    mutate(  
      sample_mean = pull(broom::tidy(test), estimate),
      p_value = pull(broom::tidy(test), p.value)
      )
}
```
