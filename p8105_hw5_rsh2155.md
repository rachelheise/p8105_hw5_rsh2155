## Problem 2

Create dataframe containing names of data files.

``` r
longitudinal_df = 
  tibble(files = list.files("./data/"))
```

Add data from each file to dataframe.

``` r
longitudinal_df =
  longitudinal_df %>% 
  mutate(data = map(file.path("./data/", files), read_csv))
```

## Problem 3

``` r
n = 30
sigma = 5
mu = 0


t_test_sim = function(samp_size, mu, sigma) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(samp_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
  )
  
  test = t.test(dataset)
  
  sim_data %>% 
    mutate(  
      sample_mean = pull(broom::tidy(test), estimate),
      p_value = pull(broom::tidy(test), p.value)
      )
}
```
